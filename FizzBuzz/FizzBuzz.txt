The FizzBuzz challenge goes something like this. Write a function that does the following:

console logs the numbers from 1 to n, where n is the integer the function takes as its parameter
logs fizz instead of the number for multiples of 3
logs buzz instead of the number for multiples of 5
logs fizzbuzz for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5
fizzBuzz(5)
// 1
// 2
// fizz
// 4
// buzz
